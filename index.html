                <div> <b>PREMISE</b> </div>
                The course I created this project in is called COGS 120/CSE 170: Interaction Design, which focused on designing technology for intuitive user understanding. It was taught by Professor Scott Klemmer, co-founder of the Design Lab at UCSD. My teammates were Kenneth Truong and Victoria Vu, and we had less than 8 weeks to develop a web application.     
                <p></p>
                <div> <b>NEEDFINDING</b> </div>
                To identify the problem that we were going to work on, my teammates and I interviewed students, observing user needs and establishing a user Point of View. 

                <img src="img/portfolio/needfinding.png" alt=""><p></p>     

                <div> <b>INSPIRATION BOARD</b> </div>
                My team and I agreed to tackle the issue of exercise and how difficult it can be to stay motivated. We created the following Point of View: "Achieving one’s goals, specifically health related ones, can seem daunting and challenging, but sometimes all it takes is a little motivation to reach them. A helping hand can help push those who wish to change something about themselves." To generate ideas of what our app would do, we created an inspiration board and a competitive analysis chart. 
                <img src="img/portfolio/inspiration.png" alt="">             
                <img src="img/portfolio/competitive.png" alt=""><p></p>             

                <div> <b>STORYBOARDING</b> </div>
                We created three different storyboards following the same Point of View to further develop ideas of our app.
                <img src="img/portfolio/storyboards.png" alt=""><p></p>  

                <div> <b>DEVELOPMENT PLAN</b> </div> 
                We updated a weekly development plan to keep us accountable for the work that we’ve done and still needed to do. 
                <img src="img/portfolio/devplan.png" alt=""><p></p>  

                <div> <b>PAPER PROTOTYPING </b></div>
                My team and I created two versions of the app through paper prototyping, and gained user feedback from peers and staff. We thoroughly observed Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics during this time. Our goal was to create an app that helps schedule exercises and workouts that works with the user’s schedule. 
                <img src="img/portfolio/pprototypes.png" alt=""><p></p>  

                <div> <b>WIREFRAMING </b> </div>
                With new feedback, my team and I designed wireframes through Figma. 
                <img src="img/portfolio/wireframes.png" alt=""><p></p>  

                <div> <b>CODING </b> </div>
                We then started creating the skeleton of the app through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                <img src="img/portfolio/skeleton.png" alt=""><p></p>  

                <div> <b>PROTOTYPING </b> </div>
                We went through several iterations of the app, testing different types of colors, and formats.
                <img src="img/portfolio/protos.png" alt=""><p></p>  


                <div> <b>USABILITY TESTING </b> </div> 
                We tested our new high-fidelity prototypes by assigning user tasks to students and recording their reactions. We asked them to use the think aloud method while using our app to identify any user breakdowns, as well what was intuitive and what was not.
                <img src="img/portfolio/usability.png" alt=""><p></p>  


                <div> <b>A/B TESTING </b> </div>
                We created an alternative version for one of our pages, the “Exercise Library”, in order to compare if either was better than the other. We did this through a process of using Google Analytics to compare conversion rates.

                <img src="img/portfolio/ga.png" alt=""><p></p>  



                <div> <b> FINAL PROTOTYPE </b> </div>
                Our final prototype had the following: 1) Random motivational quote generator to inspire users upon logging in 2) Exercise library to educate users about existing exercises 3) Goals checklist to keep the users in track of their progress 4) Schedule coordinator (hardcoded) to assign workouts in between gaps in one’s schedule. <a href= "https://a10-esgeddit.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Final Prototype.</a> (User: user / Password: password)
                <p></p>
                <div> <b> PRESENTATION </b> </div>
                We gave an elevator pitch in front of hundreds of our peers, as well as several distinguished guests such as Jon Kies, Senior Director User Experience at Qualcomm. Following this, we displayed a poster that represented all our work, at a poster session.

                <div> <b>PREMISE</b> </div>
                The course I created this project in was COGS 100: Cyborgs Now and in the Future taught by Professor David Kirsh, head of the Interactive Cognition Lab at UCSD. I worked with a team of a diverse group of nine to prototype a mechanical cyborg part to enhance a user’s capabilities through distributed cognition. The process was nine weeks. 
                <p></p>
                <div> <b>BRAINSTORMING </b> </div> 
                A majority of our team was interested in solving a common problem for many college students: anxiety. We noticed that many students face an overwhelming amount of worry at UCSD, whether it be because of academics, social life, or financial reasons. With this knowledge, we wanted to design a cyborg part that reduces a user’s anxiety. 
                <p></p>
                <div> <b>RESEARCH </b> </div>
                Using UCSD’s VPN, we gained access to many academic articles and research papers that gave us further insight on anxiety and its potential treatments. We also looked at other products in the market that have a similar goal for inspiration. 
                <img src="img/portfolio/literature.png" alt="">  
                <p></p>
                <div> <b>USER SCENARIO </b> </div>
                Our user scenario reflects a potential situation that our cyborg part may be useful for. In this case, a speaker gets nervous when speaking in public, and our cyborg part reacts to it immediately.

                <p></p>

                <div> <b>FINAL PROTOTYPE </b> </div> 
                Our final prototype uses the mechanisms ECG signals and Piezoelectric Transducers to measure the user's temperature, heart rate, and breathing patterns without being obtrusive. When the user experiences a high amount of anxiety, the two-piece wearable uses bilateral stimulation to provide vibrations to the brain in a rhythmic left-right pattern. This engages the sympathetic nervous system that is responsible for the fight-or-flight response and shifts the user into the more rational, relaxed parasympathetic nervous system. The process allows the user to perceive stressful experiences in a less stressful way, reducing the user's anxiety.

              <p>For my COGS 102C course at UCSD, called Cognitive Design Studio, I recruited four other students to create a design solution for commuter students. Together, we gathered a great amount of research, planned out a variety of prototypes, and finally created our solution: a cleaner, more efficient physical signage system for UCSD shuttles.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>INSPIRATION</strong></p>
              <p>The idea of reaching out to commuter students began with my idea of designing for parking, as I found parking to be a true struggle during my time in San Diego. I have experienced too many occassions where I find a parking spot that could fit my car IF ONLY the cars next to it were parked a little better (maybe 2 more inches to one direction). I wanted to optimize efficiency in space when cars are parking, so that there could be less stress and hassle for people that want to park in busy areas - after all, sharing is caring.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>After several meetings with my teammates, we decided to focus on a smaller scope of parking issues in order to truly create something that could make an impact. We settled on the topic of commuting, as we were all students that commuted to school, and were familiar with the pain of taking the bus and shuttles.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>STAKEHOLDERS</strong></p>
              <p>We chose our primary stakeholders to be commuters that take the UCSD shuttle system because we wanted to focus on students and their commutes to and from school. Their experiences are fundamentally what we strived to learn about and expected to improve on.</p>
              <p>Our secondary stakeholders were the student shuttle drivers, as they are the most closely related to the shuttle riders and their experiences.</p>
              <p>For our tertiary stakeholders, we identfied them as 1) the UCSD Transportation Office and other administration offices, whom benefit from better commuting solutions (i.e increased revenues and better student experiences), 2) university professors, who would see increased class attendance and better student performance because a better commute solution leads to better attendance and less stress for a student, and 3) construction workers, who benefit from streamlined shuttle schedules.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>RESEARCH PROCESS</strong></p>
              <p>We began our process with deciding which group would be better to study and research: MTS bus riders or UCSD shuttle riders. We went with UCSD shuttle riders because our communication with the MTS Administration was severely limited in comparison to UCSD Shuttle Administration. We were then able to get more permissions and information from students associated with the UCSD Shuttle System.</p>
              <p>Following our decision, we gathered data through an open Google Survey Form asking about personal commuting experiences on the UCSD Facebook page. We asked questions such as how students got to school, how long their commute was, what routes that they took, etc. Our data proved as a great source for the design models that we would create later.</p>
              <p>We also split up and conducted face-to-face interviews with ~5 people a week. We would ask the same questions: how did they get to school, how long their commutes were, and if they had experienced any problems thus far.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>After conducting over 50 face-to-face interviews, we consolidated our data through an affinity diagram. The diagram was very helpful in grouping up similar ideas and categories, allowing us to see the similarities between students and their experiences.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We also created a Day-In-Life and Sequence model to get a closer look on our stakeholders and their lives.</p>
              <p>Following this, we created 5 different Persona models based on our data to define a better idea of our stakeholders and their needs.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>PROTOTYPES</strong></p>
              <p>Our early prototypes focused on improving the map of the UCSD shuttle system. We designed different ways that the route could be seen, implementing important landmarks, and using color to accentuate the different routes. Our next iterations included a QR Code and simplified timetables, as it would help our stakeholders have a better idea of when their route would be arriving or leaving. Finally, our last prototype implemented a giant sign that showed the different stops as well as a QR Code for livetimes.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>PREMISE</strong></p>
                <p>This is a website I built off of a free W3 Schools template for my girlfriend Gabby's and my 1 year anniversary! I wanted to surprise her, as well as show the world our story thus far. I had a lot of fun making it, tinkering with different features on the page and trying to get different things on the page to work the way I imagined them (the link navigation thing took me a while to implement, but it was definitely worth it). I really liked incorporating small details and little quirky things like the different icons. In general, it was a really fun project to work on. When I showed her the site at 12:00 AM, she absolutely loved it.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>PREMISE</strong></p>
              <p>This project was for my COGS 108:&nbsp;Data Science in Practice course at UCSD. I worked with three other very talented students for ~10 weeks to design a research question, answer it through data collection practices, and present our findings. We worked&nbsp;mostly&nbsp;with Jupyter notebooks, a Python IDE. We also applied several packages such as numpy, scipy, and seaborn to get our desired results.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>PROCESS</strong></p>
              <p>We began with deciding what to gather data on. One of our members, Austin, brought up the idea that street conditions can often lead to more traffic. With that idea, we decided to focus on the correlation between traffic and road conditions specifically in LA.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We gathered our dataframes from the lacounty.gov site, finding traffic and road conditions. At this point we had to standardize how to measure road conditions; we&nbsp;found&nbsp;out that roads can be measured by their PCI (Pavement Condition Index), where 0 is bad and 100 is good. To standardize how we measured traffic, we transformed the 24 Hr. Total Volume of a certain day into a variable called "Traffic", where the higher the number means higher the traffic.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>After wrangling and cleaning our data, we put the data into different displays: histogram, bar graphs, and a seaborn-based-package plot. Following the display, we analyzed the data for a correlation.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
              <p>We concluded that there was no clear correlation between the road conditions and traffic based on the OLS Regression Results in our data analysis. However, we did find that there is a strong grouping of an inverse relationship given the negative correlation coefficient.</p>
              <p>This project was the first time that I used Python, and I thought it was a very rewarding learning experience. Coming out of it, I learned how to gather data from online and use it however I wanted to through several sequences of transformations.</p>

              <p><strong>PREMISE</strong></p>
              <p>This project is a full-stack SaaS app that I am currently still working on. The intention behind the project is to help connect entrepeneurs with developers in order to create ideas that have never been seen before - who knows, maybe they'll be creating the next big startup!&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
              <p>For the front-end, I will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, SCSS, and jQuery. For the back-end, I will be using PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.</p>
              <p><strong>TO BE DETERMINED</strong></p>
              <p>This project is still under construction, so please check back for a finished product!&nbsp;</p>
